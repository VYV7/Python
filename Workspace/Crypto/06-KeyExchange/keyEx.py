https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/16196/what-is-a-generator
A generator of a finite group is a value g such that all elements of the group 
can be represented as g^k for some integer k. 
Another key of looking at it is that if we consider the sequence g,  g*g,  g*g*g,..., 
saying g is a generator means that all values in the group will appear somewhere in the sequence.

when it comes to Diffie-Hellman, generator is used in two slightly different meanings

1. a "generator" is defined to be an element that generates the entire group.
we say that g generates the entire group means gkmodp can take on any value between 1 and pâˆ’1.

2. we say that an element g "generates" a subgroup. 
That is, when we consider all the possible values gkmodp, those possible values also form a group , 
and it makes sense to consider the Diffie-Hellman operation over this subgroup. In this case, 
we may call g the "generator" (even if it doesn't generate the full group). 
Now, this doesn't denote anything special about g (because all elements generate some subgroup by this meaning), 
instead we call g the generator to denote that it's the element we have chosen to use.
